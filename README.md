Number Facts is a watch face developed on Android Wear devices. It shows facts that are linked with the number of the current minute. This makes glancing at your watch a much more interesting experience. Did you know that 40 is the highest number ever counted on Sesame Street? Or that 23 is the number of times Julius Caesar was stabbed? Or that 29 is the number of years Saturn requires to orbit the Sun? Watch out and you might learn something new!
